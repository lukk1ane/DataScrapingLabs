Full Moon over Noahâs Ark: An Odyssey to Mount Ararat and Beyond,49.43,In stock (15 available),4,"Acclaimed travel writer Rick Antonson sets his adventurous compass on Mount Ararat, exploring the regionâs long history, religious mysteries, and complex politics.Mount Ararat is the most fabled mountain in the world.

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noahâs Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountainâs nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurdsâ ambitions for their own nationâs borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark is one manâs odyssey, a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world. ...more",Travel

Whether itâs trying to impress her parents with a perfect GPA, undergoing an exorsism in the hopes of saving her toxic marriage, or maintaining the BMI of âa flapper with a touch of dysentery,â Salie is the ultimate approval seekerâan âapproval junkie,â if you will. In âMiss Aphrodite,â she recounts her strategy for winning the high school beauty pageant. (âNot to brag or anything, but no one stood a chance against my emaciated, spastic resolve.â) âWhat I Wore to My Divorceâ describes Salieâs struggle to pick the perfect outfit to wear to the courthouse to divorce her âwasband.â (âI envisioned a look that said, âYo, THIS is what youâll be missingâ¦even though youâve introduced your new girlfriend to our mutual friends, and sheâs a decade younger than I am and is also a fit model.â) In ""Ovary Achiever,"" she shares tips on how to ace your egg retrieval.

Equal parts laugh-out loud funny and poignant, Approval Junkie is one womanâs journey to realizing that seeking approval from others is more than just getting them to like youâit's challenging yourself to achieve, and survive, more than you ever thought you could. ...more",Autobiography

G On one side, there is Grace: prize-winning author Diana Abu-Jaberâs tough, independent sugar-fiend of a German grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on anything: not about food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. Grace warned her away from children. Bud wanted her married above allâeven if he had to provide the ring. Caught between cultures and lavished with contradictory âadviceâ from both sides of her family, Diana spent years learning how to ignore othersâ well-intentioned prescriptions.Hilarious, gorgeously written, poignant, and wise, Life Without a Recipe is Dianaâs celebration of journeying without a map, of learning to ignore the script and improvise, of escaping family and making family on oneâs own terms. As Diana discovers, however, building confidence in oneâs own path sometimes takes a mistaken marriage or twoâor in her case, three: to a longhaired boy-poet, to a dashing deconstructionist literary scholar, and finally to her steadfast, outdoors-loving Scott. It also takes a good deal of angst (was it possible to have a serious writing career and be a mother?) and, even when she knew what she wanted (the craziest thing, in oneâs late forties: a baby!), the nerve to pursue it.Finally, fearlessly independent like the Grace sheâs named after, Diana and Scottâs daughter Gracie will heal all the old battles with Bud and, like her writer-mom, learn to cook up a life without a recipe. ...more",Autobiography

For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page ack Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled ""Here is a drawing of a stapler:""). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a ""single mother"" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G. already. ""The book thereafter is kind of uneven,"" he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park ...more",Autobiography

Chronicling his stint on the barricades in Mos From the winner of the National Book Award and the National Books Criticsâ Circle Awardâand one of the most original thinkers of our timeâa riveting collection of essays about places in dramatic transition.Far and Away collects Andrew Solomonâs writings about places undergoing seismic shiftsâpolitical, cultural, and spiritual. Chronicling his stint on the barricades in Moscow in 1991, when he joined artists in resisting the coup whose failure ended the Soviet Union, his 2002 account of the rebirth of culture in Afghanistan following the fall of the Taliban, his insightful appraisal of a Myanmar seeped in contradictions as it slowly, fitfully pushes toward freedom, and many other stories of profound upheaval, this book provides a unique window onto the very idea of social change. With his signature brilliance and compassion, Solomon demonstrates both how history is altered by individuals, and how personal identities are altered when governments alter.A journalist and essayist of remarkable perception and prescience, Solomon captures the essence of these cultures. Ranging across seven continents and twenty-five years, Far and Away takes a magnificent journey into the heart of extraordinarily diverse experiences, yet Solomon finds a common humanity wherever he travels. Illuminating the development of his own genius, his stories are always intimate and often both funny and deeply moving. ...more",Nonfiction
