Looking for answers to todayâs wrenching challenges, William Martin turns to the Tao Te Ching and finds that while Taoism is known for its quiet, enigmatic wisdom, the Tao can also have the cleansing force of a rushing river.Through his interpretation of this ancient Chinese text, Martin elucidates revolutionary messages condemning power-seeking and greed. He emphasizes that humans have a ânatural virtueâ that can help them heal the planet; shows how Taoismâs simplicity can be subversive and its flexibility a potent force; and reassures that âwhen injustice is the rule, justice always lies in wait.âProvocative and stirring, Martinâs Tao flows within and through those who ride the waves of anger and frustration and gently guides them to true freedom.âWe have learned the secret of transformation: Injustice feeds our determination.

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Â£54.29,In stock (3 available),5,"Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story?

What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled ""Here is a drawing of a stapler:""). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a ""single mother"" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G. already. ""The book thereafter is kind of uneven,"" he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park ...more",Autobiography

Whether itâs trying to impress her parents with a perfect GPA, undergoing an exorsism in the hopes of saving her toxic marriage, or maintaining the BMI of âa flapper with a touch of dysentery,â Salie is the ultimate approval seekerâan âapproval junkie,â if you will. In âMiss Aphrodite,â she recounts her strategy for winning the high school beauty pageant. (âNot to brag or anything, but no one stood a chance against my emaciated, spastic resolve.â) âWhat I Wore to My Divorceâ describes Salieâs struggle to pick the perfect outfit to wear to the courthouse to divorce her âwasband.â (âI envisioned a look that said, âYo, THIS is what youâll be missingâ¦even though youâve introduced your new girlfriend to our mutual friends, and sheâs a decade younger than I am and is also a fit model.â) In ""Ovary Achiever,"" she shares tips on how to ace your egg retrieval. (âThank your fertility doctor when she announces you have âamazing ovaries.â Try to be humble about it [âOh,these old things?â].â)Â And in âWait, Wait, Donât Tell Me About Batmanâs Nipplesâ she reveals the secrets behindÂ Wait Waitâ¦Donât Tell Me! (âI study for this show like Tracy Flick on Adderallâ). With thoughtful irreverence, Salie reflects on why she tries so hard to please others, and herself, highlighting a phenomenon that many peopleâespecially womenâexperience at home and in the workplace. Equal parts laugh-out loud funny and poignant, Approval Junkie is one womanâs journey to realizing that seeking approval from others is more than just getting them to like youâit's challenging yourself to achieve, and survive, more than you ever thought you could. ...more",Autobiography

On the other, Bud: a flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument.

G On one side, there is Grace: prize-winning author Diana Abu-Jaberâs tough, independent sugar-fiend of a German grandmother, wielding a suitcase full of holiday cookies. On the other, Bud: a flamboyant, spice-obsessed Arab father, full of passionate argument. The two could not agree on anything: not about food, work, or especially about what Diana should do with her life. Grace warned her away from children. Bud wanted her married above allâeven if he had to provide the ring. Caught between cultures and lavished with contradictory âadviceâ from both sides of her family, Diana spent years learning how to ignore othersâ well-intentioned prescriptions.Hilarious, gorgeously written, poignant, and wise, Life Without a Recipe is Dianaâs celebration of journeying without a map, of learning to ignore the script and improvise, of escaping family and making family on oneâs own terms. As Diana discovers, however, building confidence in oneâs own path sometimes takes a mistaken marriage or twoâor in her case, three: to a longhaired boy-poet, to a dashing deconstructionist literary scholar, and finally to her steadfast, outdoors-loving Scott. It also takes a good deal of angst (was it possible to have a serious writing career and be a mother?) and, even when she knew what she wanted (the craziest thing, in oneâs late forties: a baby!), the nerve to pursue it.Finally, fearlessly independent like the Grace sheâs named after, Diana and Scottâs daughter Gracie will heal all the old battles with Bud and, like her writer-mom, learn to cook up a life without a recipe. ...more",Autobiography
