Build a web scraper that implements multiple anti-detection techniques while collecting book
data from https://books.toscrape.com/
● Scrape 20 books from at least 3 different categories
● Extract: title, price, availability, star rating, description, category
● Focus on books with 4+ star ratings (implement smart filtering)
● Save results to CSV with proper data validation
Anti-Detection Techniques to Implement
1. User-Agent Rotation: Cycle through at least 5 different browser User-Agents
2. Smart Delays: Variable delays (1-3s for navigation, 3-6s for reading pages)
3. Session Management: Use persistent sessions with cookie handling
4. Human-like Navigation: Browse categories, human courser imitation
5. Error Handling: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
6. Request Headers: Include realistic Accept, Referer, and other headers
